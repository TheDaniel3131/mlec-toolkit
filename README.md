# MLEC - Make Life Easier Commands

A Makefile toolkit for quickly scaffolding web development projects.

## üìã Overview

**MLEC** (Make Life Easier Commands) is a comprehensive Makefile toolkit designed to streamline the creation of various web development projects. Instead of remembering complex npm/npx commands, simply use short make commands to scaffold your projects instantly.

**Key Differences:**

- **Toolkit vs Script:** A toolkit provides a complete set of organized tools and utilities (like this collection of make commands), while a script is typically a single executable file. This toolkit offers multiple interconnected commands working together as a cohesive development environment.
